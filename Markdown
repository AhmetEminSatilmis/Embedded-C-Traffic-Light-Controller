# Smart Traffic Light Controller (Embedded C)

This project demonstrates a bare-metal embedded C implementation of a **Traffic Light Control System** using a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** architecture.

It is designed to simulate low-level hardware interaction typically found in microcontrollers like STM32 or AVR, without relying on high-level libraries (HAL).

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Finite State Machine (FSM):** Uses function pointers to manage state transitions (Stop -> Ready -> Go) efficiently, avoiding complex `if-else` spaghetti code.
* **Direct Register Access:** Simulates Memory-Mapped I/O using `uint32_t` pointers and `structs`, mimicking real hardware register maps.
* **Bit Manipulation:** Uses bitwise operators (`|`, `&`, `~`, `<<`) for setting and clearing specific bits in the Output Data Register (ODR).
* **Hardware Abstraction:** Includes a virtual hardware layer (`VIRTUAL_MEMORY`) allowing the code to be tested and debugged on a PC environment before deploying to actual hardware.

## 🛠️ Technical Concepts Applied

* **Pointers & Volatile:** Correct usage of `volatile` for hardware registers.
* **Structs & Unions:** creating memory maps for peripherals.
* **Function Pointers:** Implementing callback-style state transitions.
* **Bitwise Logic:** Masking and shifting operations.

## 💻 Code Structure

```c
// Example of the State Machine Logic
void (*Next_State)(void) = State_Stop; 

int main() {
    while(1) {
        Next_State(); // Execute the current state
    }
}
